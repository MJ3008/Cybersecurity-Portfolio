# 🔐 Python Network Port Scanner

A Python-based network reconnaissance tool that scans a target system for open TCP ports.  
This tool demonstrates how security analysts and penetration testers identify exposed services.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Scans ports from 1 to 1024  
- Detects open TCP ports  
- Uses socket programming  
- Fast and lightweight  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Socket Library  
- Kali Linux  

---

## 📌 How It Works
The scanner attempts to connect to each port on the target IP address.  
If the connection is successful, the port is marked as **OPEN**, indicating an active service.

This technique is widely used in:
- Penetration Testing  
- Network Security Audits  
- Vulnerability Assessments
